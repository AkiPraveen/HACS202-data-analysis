    "First, let's extract the data from the `mitm_files` folder. This script is a little involved, but it essentially separates the log into 'attacks'. Each attack is considered begun when the script detects a connection initiated, and each attack is considered ended when the script detecs that the connection is closed. From this, we extract the date & time of the attack, whether a password was used, the IP address of the attacker, and the client that the attacker was using.\n",
